    "\n",
    "The three primary criteria we seek when designing an algorithm are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Correctness**: The algorithm must produce the correct output for all valid inputs. An algorithm is correct if it:\n",
    "   - Produces the desired output for every input\n",
    "   - Terminates in finite time\n",
    "   - Solves the stated problem completely\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Efficiency**: The algorithm should use computational resources optimally:\n",
    "   - **Time Complexity**: How fast the algorithm runs (measured in operations or Big-O notation)\n",
    "   - **Space Complexity**: How much memory the algorithm requires\n",
    "   - Efficiency allows algorithms to scale to large problem instances\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Clarity/Simplicity**: The algorithm should be:\n",
    "   - Easy to understand and implement\n",
    "   - Well-documented and maintainable\n",
    "   - Robust to edge cases\n",
    "   - Simple algorithms are less error-prone and easier to optimize\n",

    "   - Greedily select the interval with the earliest start time, then repeatedly select the next compatible interval\n",
    "   - **Correctness**: This strategy is NOT always optimal (counterexample: one long interval can prevent multiple short intervals from being selected)\n",

    "**Algorithm Steps:**\n",

    "        a. If start_time[i] ≥ last_finish:  // No overlap with last selected\n",
    "            i.   Add interval i to selected\n",
    "            ii.  Update last_finish = finish_time[i]\n",
    "    4. Return selected (the set of chosen intervals)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Time Complexity**: $O(n \\log n)$ (dominated by sorting)\n",

    "**Correctness Proof Sketch**:\n",
    "- By exchange argument: If an optimal solution differs from EFT, we can repeatedly replace the first differing interval with the EFT choice\n",
    "- EFT's interval finishes earlier, leaving more room for future intervals\n",
    "- This exchange preserves optimality, showing EFT is optimal\n",

    "### Question 2: Why Nearest Neighbor for TSP is a Heuristic, Not an Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Nearest Neighbor** algorithm for Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP):\n",
    "```\n",
    "NearestNeighbor(graph G, start vertex v):\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it's a heuristic, not a correct algorithm:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **No Optimality Guarantee**: Nearest Neighbor does NOT guarantee the shortest tour\n",
    "   - Example: A local greedy choice (nearest neighbor) may lead to a global suboptimal solution\n",
    "   - The algorithm can take a long edge later to compensate, resulting in a worse overall tour\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Unbounded Approximation**: There is no constant $c$ such that NearestNeighbor ≤ $c$ × Optimal for all instances\n",
    "   - Poor approximation ratios in worst-case scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **TSP is NP-Hard**: No known polynomial-time algorithm solves TSP optimally\n",
    "   - Therefore, we use heuristics and approximation algorithms instead\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Practical Trade-off**: We accept suboptimal solutions for computational efficiency\n",
    "   - Nearest Neighbor runs in $O(n^2)$ time (vs. $O(n! \\cdot n)$ for exhaustive search)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example of Suboptimality**:\n",

    "A(0,0), B(1,0), C(1,1), D(0,1)\n",

    "Nearest Neighbor: A → B → C → D → A (distance ≈ 4)\n",

    "| **Conclusion** | $P(n)$ is true for all $n \\geq 0$ | Invariant is true throughout loop execution; implies algorithm correctness |\n",

    "Initialization: Before loop, selected = ∅, which is trivially optimal for empty input\n",
    "Maintenance: If invariant holds after i intervals, when we process interval i+1:\n",

    "  - If Iᵢ₊₁ is compatible, we add it (maximizes the count)\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 4: What Does It Mean for TSP to be NP-Hard?\n",
    "\n",
    "**NP-Hard Definition:**\n",
    "A problem is **NP-hard** if:\n",
    "1. It is at least as hard as the hardest problems in the NP (Nondeterministic Polynomial) class\n",
    "2. If a polynomial-time algorithm exists for any NP-hard problem, then P = NP (one of the greatest unsolved problems in computer science)\n",
    "\n",
    "**What This Means for TSP:**\n",

    "- **No Known Polynomial Solution**: Despite decades of research, no algorithm is known that solves TSP in polynomial time $O(n^k)$ for any fixed $k$\n",
    "- **Exhaustive Search Required (Worst Case)**: The best known exact algorithms for TSP have exponential time complexity $O(n!)$ or $O(n^2 \\cdot 2^n)$\n",
    "- **Practical Approach**: For large TSP instances, we use:\n",
    "  - **Heuristics** (Nearest Neighbor, Genetic Algorithms)\n",
    "  - **Approximation Algorithms** (guaranteed to be within some factor of optimal)\n",
    "  - **Meta-heuristics** (Simulated Annealing, Ant Colony Optimization)\n",
    "- **Small Instances**: For $n \\leq 20$ cities, exact algorithms can find optimal solutions\n",
    "- **Implication**: If someone discovers a polynomial-time algorithm for TSP, it would prove P = NP and revolutionize computer science\n",

    "### Question 5: How Modularity Contributes to Algorithm Ease of Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Modularity** in algorithm design means breaking down a complex algorithm into smaller, independent, reusable components (modules or functions).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits for Implementation Ease:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Separation of Concerns**\n",
    "   - Each module has a single, well-defined responsibility\n",
    "   - Example: Separate functions for data generation, sorting, and checking compatibility\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Code Reusability**\n",
    "   - A sorting function can be used by multiple algorithms (EFT, EST, SD)\n",
    "   - Compatibility checking can be used by greedy and exhaustive algorithms\n",
    "   - Reduces code duplication\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Testability**\n",
    "   - Each module can be tested independently\n",
    "   - Easier to identify bugs and verify correctness\n",
    "   - Example: Test the compatibility checker with various interval pairs first\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Readability and Maintenance**\n",
    "   - Main algorithm logic is clearer when delegating to helper functions\n",
    "   - Others can understand the code more quickly\n",
    "   - Fixes and improvements are localized to specific modules\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Debugging and Optimization**\n",
    "   - Isolating a module makes debugging faster\n",
    "   - Performance bottlenecks can be identified and optimized without affecting other parts\n",
    "   - Example: Optimize the sorting step without affecting interval selection logic\n",

    "### Question 1: Proof by Contradiction - Greedy Algorithm for Interval Scheduling\n",
    "\n",
    "**Claim**: The Earliest Finish Time (EFT) greedy algorithm selects the maximum number of compatible intervals (is optimal).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Proof by Contradiction:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume, for contradiction, that there exists an instance where:\n",
    "- $G$ = set of intervals selected by EFT greedy algorithm, with $|G| = m$\n",
    "- $O$ = an optimal solution with $|O| = k$, where $k > m$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Setup:**\n",
    "Let $G = \\{g_1, g_2, \\ldots, g_m\\}$ sorted by finish time, and let $O = \\{o_1, o_2, \\ldots, o_k\\}$ also sorted by finish time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Observation:**\n",
    "Since EFT always selects the interval with the earliest finish time at each step, we have:\n",
    "$$\\text{finish}(g_i) \\leq \\text{finish}(o_i) \\text{ for all } i = 1, 2, \\ldots, m$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Proof Argument:**\n",
    "- Consider the first $m$ intervals in both $G$ and $O$\n",
    "- By the above observation: $\\text{finish}(g_i) \\leq \\text{finish}(o_i)$ for $i = 1, \\ldots, m$\n",
    "- This means $g_m$ finishes no later than $o_m$\n",
    "- Therefore, any interval starting after $g_m$ also starts after $o_m$\n",
    "- But $O$ has $k > m$ intervals, meaning there's at least one more interval after $o_m$\n",
    "- This interval must also be compatible with intervals after $g_m$ (since it is with $o_m$)\n",
    "- This contradicts the greedy algorithm stopping at $m$ intervals\n",

    "\n",
    "**Problem**: Robot Tour Optimization with 20 points - how many permutations?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analysis:**\n",
    "- Number of distinct tours: $(n-1)!/2$ for a symmetric tour (accounting for direction)\n",
    "- For $n = 20$ points: $(20-1)!/2 = 19!/2$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Calculation:**\n",
    "$$19! = 19 \\times 18 \\times 17 \\times \\cdots \\times 2 \\times 1 \\approx 1.22 \\times 10^{17}$$\n",

    "**Why Impractical:**\n",
    "- If a computer can evaluate $10^9$ tours per second (extremely optimistic)\n",
    "- Time needed: $\\frac{1.22 \\times 10^{17}}{10^9} \\approx 1.22 \\times 10^8$ seconds\n",
